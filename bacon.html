    <h1>Oven Baked Bacon</h1>
    <img src="img/bacon.jpeg">
    <p>Do you want bacon but not want to stand in front of a stove and get burned
        by bacon grease? Yes you do. Why are you not cooking your bacon in the oven?
    </p>
    <p>It's more consistent, easier to clean up, and takes about the same amount of time.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and supplies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bacon. However much you want to eat.</li>
        <li>A quarter sheet pan. Available at a restaurant supply store. </li>
        <li>Aluminum foil. Available at probably literally every store. </li>
        <li>Rack for the sheet pan. These will be right next to the sheet pans at the restaurant store.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line your sheet pan with aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Place your rack on the foil-lined sheet pan</li>
        <li>Put as much bacon as you want to eat on the rack. So all of it.</li>
        <li>Pop the whole thing in a cold oven and set the oven to 375.</li>
        <li>Once the oven is preheated, you should be about ready to flip. Flip the bacon and 
            cook another 15 minutes or so on the other side. 
        </li>
        <li>Cook, flipping regularly until the bacon is done to your desired level of crispness</li>
        <li>Devour</li>
    </ol>
